Primitive Data Types //byte /short /int //long //float double //boolean
char

non primitives object and objects are created by classes
Data Structure:
 1. Array
 2. Collection ==> only accepts objects
 3. Map ==> only accepts objects

 primitives: byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean
 wrapper classes: the difference between primitive data and wrapper classes
 is that  these are all capital letters as opposed to
 primitive data types initiated with lowercase
Byte, Short, Integer, Long, Float, Double, Character, Boolean

//Java Wrapper Classes
//Wrapper classes provide a way to use primitive data types (int, boolean, etc..) as objects.
//The table below shows the primitive type and the equivalent wrapper class:
//
//Primitive Data Type          Wrapper Class
byte                           Byte
short                          Short
int                            Integer
float                          Float
double                         Double
boolean                        Boolean
char                           Character
sometimes you must use wrapper classes, for example when working with collection objects, sucha as ArrayList
where primitive types cannot be used (the list can oly store objects)

example:   ArrayList<int> myNumbers = new ArrayList<in>(); //invalid this would not work the correct way is as follows
ArrayList<Integer> myNumbers = new ArrayList<Integer>(); this is valid
