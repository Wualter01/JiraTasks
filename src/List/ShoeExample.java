/*
custom classes which will be your library for shoes

ArrayList class examples                  shoe
data : can be any type of object          data:shoe object
functions : add, remove , size ,get..     functions : brand,size, color
                                          wear() , getShoeInfo

idea of creating object from class
ArrayList <> list   =new ArrayList();
Class refName          OBJECT

shoe nike = new Shoe(); - shoe is my class name nike is the reference to my class or having to do with my class
=new shoe and now ive created an object of my shoe class

class :  It is where you actually implement your code. you store variables methods inside your class
this is where you create an object from . Class will explain behaviour of objects
